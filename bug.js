This bug occurs when using the Expo ImagePicker library and attempting to access the `uri` property of the selected image. The `uri` property sometimes returns `undefined` even though the image selection process was successful. This leads to errors and unexpected behavior in the app. The inconsistency is not directly caused by user interaction but seems to be a timing issue or asynchronous behavior within Expo's ImagePicker component.
